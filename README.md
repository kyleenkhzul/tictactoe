Hello, this is the code for a game of Tic Tac Toe.
You can run the program directly from the driver program. 
I have JUnit tests for my own personal use that require
Gradle if you want to test it too. Otherwise, enjoy.

How To Play Tic Tac Toe:
Tic Tac Toe is a two player turn-based game where each player has a symbol
they can place on a 3x3 grid. Each symbol, 'O' and 'X' represents each player.
If a player gets three in a row, (straight across, straight down, diagnol), then
that player wins. However, if no player is able to get three in a row, then the
game is a tie or also called a cat's game. 

For the program, type into the console a valid spot to place a symbol and play!
